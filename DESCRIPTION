Description: Computes the penalized maximum likelihood estimates of factor loadings and unique variances for various tuning parameters. The pathwise coordinate descent along with EM algorithm is used.  This package also includes a new graphical tool which outputs path diagram, goodness-of-fit indices and model selection criteria for each regularization parameter. The user can change the regularization parameter by manipulating scrollbars, which is helpful to find a suitable value of regularization parameter.
